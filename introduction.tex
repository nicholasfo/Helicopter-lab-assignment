\subsection{Problem description}

The purposes of this assignment is to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Derive  a  model  for  a  given  system  (the  helicopter)  that  can  be  used  for
control purposes.
    \item Derive and apply  PD and multivariable controllers in a  real-time environ-
ment.
    \item Demonstrate how states can be estimated that are not directly measured
    \item Give  an  introduction  to  optimal  control  by  developing  a  linear  quadratic
regulator (LQR) for the helicopter \cite{oppgavetekst}
\end{itemize}
